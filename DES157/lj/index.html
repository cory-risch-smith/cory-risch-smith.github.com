          <p> Micheal Gonchar's article titled, <em>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</em>, discusses ways in which people, and designers, encourages patience. Gonchar indirectly encourages patience, and presence, by exploring the value that comes from taking your time as you look and as you read. Here are 10 tricks Gunchar highlights to be used with this process:</p>

           <ol>
            <li>Be Detectives</li>
            <li>Practice Regularly</li>
            <li>Ask Open-Ended Questions</li>
            <li>Notice Details</li>
            <li>Build on Other's Observations</li>
            <li>Adapt these Questions for All Subjects</li>
            <li>Expand Knowledge of the World</li>
            <li>Start Conversations</li>
            <li>Introduce New Ideas</li>
            <li>Experiment With Other Ways to Look Closely</li>
          </ol>

          <p>As I began reading this and applying these concepts outside of the context of photography, I actually recognized the immense value this has with coding! ðŸ’»</p>

          <p>Another interesting article that Gunchar points to in his own work is that of the International Society for Technology in Education, where it discuesses strategies for teaching visual literacy.The article can accessed in the link directly below:</p>

            Naema Baskanderi writes in her article titled,
            <em>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</em>,
            about the nature and the fruition of overlays. Overlays, modals, and
            dialog windows started as a band-aid approach to communicating with
            participants. There is typically a box with information, an input,
            perhaps some checkboxes, buttons for submission or navigating to the
            next screen, and the original home screen is just blurred, or
            darkened. Overlays have turned into the industry standard for how to
            deal with this issue, which provides accessability to the
            information through presentation. Communication is more clear and
            available to participants by using modals, overlays and dialog
            windows. it provides a way to, front and center, if you will, the
            information you are asking for from the user or wanting to display
            to them.

            I am really enjoying this class so far, and this has actually been
            my favorite class so far at UCD. There is something magical that
            happens when what you're doing and what you love or enjoy to do are
            one in the same and this class is that for me. Something I learned
            from the

              usability</em

            is that placeholder text should not reside within the input field,
            but below it. The less clutter and options the better. If there are
            6 or less options in a drop-down menu, consider shifting to radio
            buttons or if there is multiple selections, best practices suggests
            using check boxes.
