          <p>In an article on UX Best practices in game design, Amir Dori highlights some key features to pay attention too and important aspects of your design that should take precedence when thinking about accessibility. Dori explains the importance of using color to influence decision making. He also notes that it is important to be mindful of game behavior when designing, so as not to create something that is either not intuitive, or is challenging to physically use for your target audience. From sliders and dragable item placement to overlays and rate messages, Dori highlights that the best UX has been birthed from data coming from the users.

           Visual Analysis for Tong:
          </h3>
          <p>At first, my eye is drawn to memory, a scene of the arrangement of color cards from DES 014 with Melissa Chandon. There is something interesting going on here, a hue of violet amongst blues and greens. It reminds me of seperation, yet unity. It reminds me that even something that is differnet can fit in and blend beautifully. Something else that is interesting is the play of pink as it traverses the blues, and how its contrast becomes more apparent as the eye travels right to left. How it becomes a spectrum of darker, more vibrant, rich, deep pink to light, from left to right. I assume the curvature in the paper is due to oxidation and natural curvature, yet resembles a cut perhaps. behind what the eye can see, the draw of the eye, what is visually foremost in the foreground, something lies beneath. It can tell a story of distraction, of veils, of covering up, of something much deeper that is there, yet our eye is drawn to what appears to be colorful and in our face. I think this photo speaks of growth, and perhaps for tong it will be an exploration to showcase an adventure or experience of a relationship with color.</p>

          <h3>Visual Analysis of my own photo:</h3>

          <p>This image is of individuals who have been killed by police and white vigilantes, and so I felt it special as it showcases them and would be a great choice for a commemorative space. This image captures each person I want to create a space to celebrate and honor their life and to showcase the beauty and qualities of their characters. I see love in this picture, I see strength, pain, perseverance. Depth. I see happiness, joy, confidence, disbelief. The photo has a quality that is seperate, yet the same. The people are seperated by the boundaries of one another, yet they are all connected. I see life. I see radience and beauty, light and absorption. I see armor, hesistance, fear, yet courage and bravery. I see grit. I see people, flesh, black skin, and beauty. I am seeing innocence. I think it shows a side of me that cares, that loves people and believes in justice. I hope it will convey police brutality as an issue that I am passionate about, but by upholding their importance.</p>

          <p> Micheal Gonchar's article titled, <em>10 Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking Skills</em>, discusses ways in which people, and designers, encourages patience. Gonchar indirectly encourages patience, and presence, by exploring the value that comes from taking your time as you look and as you read. Here are 10 tricks Gunchar highlights to be used with this process:</p>

           <ol>
            <li>Be Detectives</li>
            <li>Practice Regularly</li>
            <li>Ask Open-Ended Questions</li>
            <li>Notice Details</li>
            <li>Build on Other's Observations</li>
            <li>Adapt these Questions for All Subjects</li>
            <li>Expand Knowledge of the World</li>
            <li>Start Conversations</li>
            <li>Introduce New Ideas</li>
            <li>Experiment With Other Ways to Look Closely</li>
          </ol>

          <p>As I began reading this and applying these concepts outside of the context of photography, I actually recognized the immense value this has with coding! ðŸ’»</p>

          <p>Another interesting article that Gunchar points to in his own work is that of the International Society for Technology in Education, where it discuesses strategies for teaching visual literacy.The article can accessed in the link directly below:</p>

            Naema Baskanderi writes in her article titled,
            <em>Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</em>,
            about the nature and the fruition of overlays. Overlays, modals, and
            dialog windows started as a band-aid approach to communicating with
            participants. There is typically a box with information, an input,
            perhaps some checkboxes, buttons for submission or navigating to the
            next screen, and the original home screen is just blurred, or
            darkened. Overlays have turned into the industry standard for how to
            deal with this issue, which provides accessability to the
            information through presentation. Communication is more clear and
            available to participants by using modals, overlays and dialog
            windows. it provides a way to, front and center, if you will, the
            information you are asking for from the user or wanting to display
            to them.

            I am really enjoying this class so far, and this has actually been
            my favorite class so far at UCD. There is something magical that
            happens when what you're doing and what you love or enjoy to do are
            one in the same and this class is that for me. Something I learned
            from the
            <em
              >Best practices for form design: 20 tips to boost form
              usability</em
            >
            is that placeholder text should not reside within the input field,
            but below it. The less clutter and options the better. If there are
            6 or less options in a drop-down menu, consider shifting to radio
            buttons or if there is multiple selections, best practices suggests
            using check boxes.
