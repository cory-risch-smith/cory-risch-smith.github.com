          <h4>
            One of the first things noticed was a confusion as to whether or not
            to scroll. The experience wasn't perceived as something that was
            very fluid, in fact, it was very choppy, and suprise oriented. At
            first, the scroll took Jaiyi a long time to figure out that you
            could continue to scroll.
          </h4>

            My Plans: \n I think one of the things I am going to do is firstly,
            try and finish the project and get it to work properly. I want to
            make the words a bit smaller on the horizontal scroll and make a max
            width for the sentences that appear there as well.

          <h2>Test 2: Mindy</h2>

          <img src="images/mindy.jpg" alt="picture of user testing" />
          <h4>
            Mindy picked up the scrolling right away, but seemed a bit
            frustrated with the length of how long it takes you to scroll to get
            to the vertical shift. Because of some of the wonkiness and
            incompleteness of the project, text would appear randomly that was
            out of sequence and confused the user with what they were supposed
            to be doing. She also immediately started scrolling and when going
            back, did the same thing, not registering or clicking the button at
            all.
          </h4>

          <h4>
            My Plans: \n I think one of the things I am going to do is shorten
            up the scroll. There is a massively excessive scroll beneath the
            last portion of the site. I think I am also going to shift down the
            size of the text and perhaps rearrange the way the text location is
            placed coming at you and perhaps even add some more text boxes that
            are coming at the user.

          <h2>Test 3: Diego</h2>

          <img src="images/diego.jpg" alt="picture of user testing" />
          <h4>
            Diego clicked the button, and also seemed a bit confused with how
            long the scroll was on the word depression. I think the overall
            incompleteness of the work also created more confusion as there was
            text where there wasn't supposed to be, and the final page, the
            button wasn't very intuitive, and when clicked, it left digital
            clutter behind.
          </h4>
          <img src="images/diego1.jpg" alt="picture of user testing" />

          <h4>
            My Plans: \n I think I am going to shorten the scroll on the word
            depression and tighten that up. I'd like to try to figure out how to
            make the left behind overlays to disappear when scrolling back out.
            I may have to redesign and have an additional overaly pop up
            instead.
