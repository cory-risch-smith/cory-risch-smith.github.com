        <h2>Project Summary 1:</h2>
        <p>
          A depression simulation using CSS that offers resources and support at
          the bottom, and brings the user back out the way they came.

        <h2>Comparison Project 1: National Alliance on Mental Illness</h2>
        <p>
          Nami, the
          <a href="https://www.nami.org/home"
            >National ALliance on Mental Illness</a
          >, shares intention with my project idea and has some things that are
          working and some that could possibly use revision. One of the first
          things that is nice on arrival to the site is the big directive
          message to the viewer. I also think their color palette is soothing
          and fitting for the topic and the typeface is working well too. I
          think one thing that could possibly be improved is the information
          heirarchy. Where people can find support is in the middle, and I think
          having something straight away would be more proompt and perhaps
          fitting for an individual seeking support or help.

        <h2>Comparison Project 2: Sgrappa</h2>
        <p>
          <a href="https://www.sgrappa.com/index.html">Sgrappa</a> is another
          site that shares interest in my topic, in terms of the user interface
          and the overall flow of interaction. I think there is a lot going on
          here, but what works really well here is the use of scroll and
          animation across the z-axis, coming to meet a y-axis and scrolling
          down the y once it meets a backstop. One thing I think it could
          improve is perhaps the use of more color? Another thing that is
          working well here is the pictures positioned in each frame as it
          scrolls the z-axis, giving it a 3D feel and appearance, despite the
          images being 2D.

        <h2>Project Goals:</h2>
        <p>
          My goals for the project is to create a simulation of depression for
          the user via CSS animations through scrolling. It will have a similar
          trajectory and UI path as the scrappa site, and also have some
          interaction of messaging using scroll as well. The goal here is to
          bring the user through a visualization of depression with animation,
          but then bring them to a place, to a bottom, to a space of arrival
          where they can find information. I think that is how my project will
          also connect with the intention of Nami, in that it will be a place
          that is providing resources and information to those suffering with
          depression.

        <h2>Design Strategies:</h2>
        <p>
          I want to bring the user upon arrival to the site, into the computer
          through scroll animations across the z-axis.There will be perhaps an
          image or some text that the user can see and will scroll until that
          image is brought into full view on the screen, and as they continue to
          scroll, it will bring them down, almost as if you were going down a
          slide, or down an HVAC vent in terms of the architecture. I think the
          overall color theme for the simulation will be dark with a serif
          typeface of some kind, so it appears rounded, and softer, rather than
          rigid and tight. As you scroll down, there will be messages that speak
          to the user, and will provide a question at the bottom if they want
          some support or resources. At the bottom, it will give them an option
          to click, and upon click, will bring them back out of the way they
          came and to a lighter themed page with resources available to the
          user.

        <h2>Interaction Strategies:</h2>
        <p>
          I think the biggest strategy for interaction, is going to be the
          scrolling across the z-axis, along with downward on the y-axis once
          the image is reached. The main pbjective for this interaction is to
          simulate depression, bringing someone into the computer, and down a
          pathway that replicates the experience of depression. I also think the
          main component of interaction will lie at the bottom of the scroll
          effect, where the button will be. Upon clicking the button, the
          interaction will bring the user back out the way they came, reversing
          the scroll and to another screen, perhaps once the main screen
          reaches, fading opacity from dark to light and to a page of
          information.

        <h2>Experience Goals:</h2>
        <p>
          The main overall goals of the experience is two fold: Create a
          depression simulation through css animations, and create a simulation
          for coming out of depression towards resources that can help with
          dealing with this mental illness. I think the overall experience, I
          really want to bring the user into the screen with the scroll across
          the z-axis. the idea is to really draw them in, and talk to them along
          the way through appearing and disappearing text, and in some ways,
          very similar to what its like being alone, with our thoughts speaking
          to us, Maybe that can be another part of the experience, where the
          speaking to the user is sort of a mental simulation of thoughts
          speaking during the experience.

        <h2>Audience:</h2>
        <p>
          The main target audience is people who are struggling with or have
          been diagnosed with depression, of any sort. The audience can include
          individuals who are trying to help those with depression, or who want
          to learn more about it, but the main target is for people who are
          currently experiencing depression.
